title: About these notes
---

Hi, and welcome to our cooking notes.

These notes represent our explorations into cooking, food and eating culture. There is no index - instead the collection is linked naturally through contexts.

This idea is inspired by the digital garden concept, [bi-directional linking](https://www.roamresearch.com) and personal knowledge management.

As a starting point, why not take a look at [[Taco Night]]?
